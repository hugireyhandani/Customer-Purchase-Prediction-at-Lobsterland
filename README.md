# Customer Purchase Prediction at Lobsterland

## Introduction
This Project revolves around a classification problem aimed at predicting whether customers will purchase a package based on the `telco_churn.csv` dataset.

## Project Overview
The project's primary goal is to apply machine learning techniques to predict customer behavior. It includes:
- Logistic Regression Modeling: Building a model to predict customer purchase behavior.
- Random Forest Modeling: Developing a more complex model for the same prediction task.
- Interpretation and Analysis: Providing insights and interpretations of the models and their results.

## Methodology
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset from `telco_churn.csv`.
- **Model Development**: Implementing logistic regression and random forest models using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.
- **Analysis**: Analyzing the performance of each model and interpreting the results.

## Key Insights
- Insights into customer behavior and factors influencing their decision to purchase.
- Comparative analysis of logistic regression and random forest models in terms of their effectiveness and accuracy.
- Interpretation of model outputs, including feature importance and predictive accuracy.

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository to get access to the Jupyter notebooks.
- The notebooks are self-contained and include both the code and explanations for each step of the analysis.
